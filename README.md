# iRacing Discord Rich Presence

## Introduction

> Discord displays very limited information about your iRacing session by default, this tool changes that and displays your current track, session type and duration (more soon)

## Installation

> This will be released in a packaged version soon, for now the code will have to be downloaded and run manually. This requires Node JS to be installed on your machine.
